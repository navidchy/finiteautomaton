# Finite Automaton Lexical Analyzer

## Overview
This project is a finite automaton-based lexical analyzer wwhich takes in a string representing an arithmetic statement and produces an output sequence of tokens that represent the numbers and operators.

## Features
- Implements a deterministic finite automaton/transducer.
- Handles arithmetic expressions and errors in number and expression representation.
- Processes input character by character and emits tokens appropriately.
- Supports numbers with optional decimal points and various operators.
